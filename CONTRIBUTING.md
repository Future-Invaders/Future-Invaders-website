Contributing
===

Contributors are welcome, be it for a tiny bug fix, a refactor, or a new feature.

All contributions should be done by creating a branch of your own from `trunk`, then opening a pull request on the `trunk` branch on GitHub.

 

Monolingual contributors
===

Future Invaders is bilingual, the website is in both french and english, but it can obviously not be expected of everyone to master both languages when contributing.

If you want to provide a new feature, feel free to leave half of the translations empty.
